# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enhance chat interface with tabbed history, fix video section issues, implement real-time market trends with automatic refresh, and add autonomous exchange rate table with daily updates.

**Planned changes:**
- Refactor ChatPage to use tabbed interface with 'Current Chat' and 'History' tabs
- Fix VideoLearningPage display, loading, and functionality issues
- Implement periodic data fetching for market trends with configurable refresh intervals
- Add exchange rate table component displaying KES to major currencies (USD, EUR, GBP)
- Create backend timer for autonomous daily exchange rate updates

**User-visible outcome:** Users can organize chat conversations with a cleaner tabbed interface, access working video content, view automatically updating market trends with timestamps, and see current exchange rates that refresh daily without manual intervention.
