  "summary": "The implementation addresses REQ-6 (chat history tabs), REQ-7 (video section fixes), REQ-8 (real-time market trends), and REQ-9 (exchange rate table display). However, REQ-10 (autonomous daily backend timer for exchange rates) is missing, and there are concerns about the actual implementation of real-time functionality.",

      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Implement autonomous daily updates for exchange rate data by creating a backend timer that fetches and updates exchange rates every 24 hours. Store the update timestamp and ensure the system continues updating even after canister upgrades.",
      "reason": "No evidence of a backend timer implementation for autonomous daily exchange rate updates. The backend shows exchange rate storage and mock URLs, but no timer setup, no timer persistence across upgrades, and no automatic 24-hour update mechanism.",
